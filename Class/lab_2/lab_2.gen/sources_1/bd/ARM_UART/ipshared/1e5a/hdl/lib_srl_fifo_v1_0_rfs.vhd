-- Filename:        cntr_incr_decr_addn_f.vhd
--
-- Description:     This counter can increment, decrement or skip ahead
--                  by an arbitrary amount.
--
--                  If Reset is active, the value Cnt synchronously resets
--                  to all ones. (This reset value, different than the
--                  customary reset value of zero, caters to the original
--                  application of cntr_incr_decr_addn_f as the address
--                  counter for srl_fifo_rbu_f.)
--
--                  Otherwise, on each Clk, one is added to Cnt if Incr is
--                  asserted and one is subtracted if Decr is asserted. (If
--                  both are asserted, then there is no change to Cnt.)
--
--                  If Decr is not asserted, then the input value,
--                  Nm_to_add, is added. (Simultaneous assertion of Incr
--                  would add one more.) If Decr is asserted, then
--                  N_to_add, is ignored, i.e., it is possible to decrement
--                  by one or add N, but not both, and Decr overrides. 
--
--                  The value that Cnt will take on at the next clock
--                  is available as Cnt_p1.
