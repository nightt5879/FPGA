TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.151 ns between led_ctl_i0/led_o_reg[7]/C (clocked by clk_pin) and led_pins[7] (clocked by virtual_clock). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.161 ns between led_ctl_i0/led_o_reg[6]/C (clocked by clk_pin) and led_pins[6] (clocked by virtual_clock). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
