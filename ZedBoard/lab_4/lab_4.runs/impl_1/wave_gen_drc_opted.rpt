2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 samp_ram_i0/mem_array_reg has an input control pin samp_ram_i0/mem_array_reg/ENBWREN (net: samp_ram_i0/mem_array_reg_ENBWREN_cooolgate_en_sig_1) which is driven by a register (rst_gen_i0/reset_bridge_clk_samp_i0/rst_dst_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#2 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 samp_ram_i0/mem_array_reg has an input control pin samp_ram_i0/mem_array_reg/ENBWREN (net: samp_ram_i0/mem_array_reg_ENBWREN_cooolgate_en_sig_1) which is driven by a register (rst_gen_i0/reset_bridge_clk_samp_i0/rst_meta_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#3 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 samp_ram_i0/mem_array_reg has an input control pin samp_ram_i0/mem_array_reg/RSTREGB (net: samp_ram_i0/rst_clk_samp) which is driven by a register (rst_gen_i0/reset_bridge_clk_samp_i0/rst_dst_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
